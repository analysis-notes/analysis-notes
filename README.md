The pages are Markdown using docsify for presentation.

Simply clone the repo and run python -m SimpleHTTPSever 3000. If that doesn't work, try running python -m http.server 3000 instead.
Note, if you are running Python 3, you will get error as "No module named SimpleHTTPSever", and this is because in Python 3, SimpleHTTPSever has been merged into http.server module. You could then run python3 -m http.server 3000 instead. Then navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser.
Edit the markdown files and force-reload the page to see your changes. Sometimes you will need to clear the browser caches to reflect the changes.
